# Solid-4-The-Interface-Segregation-Principle(ISP)
This is a console application that simulates the data structure of a library application. ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend on methods they don't use and 
is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor, change, and redeploy. It is similar to the Single Responsibility Principle.
The goal is to create small indipended and reusable blocks of code that can be combined, be more flexible and not violate the Open Closed Principle.
